# Exercise 12_2
#Whats is going on here? Explain the output

tup = 'Hello'
print(len(tup))

tup = 'Hello',
print(len(tup))

#The first one print 5 because it is a string, so it prints the numbers of characters of the string
#The second one print 1 because it is a tuple and it only has one element
#The difference is in the coma, which makes it a tuple
